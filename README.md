# 03 JavaScript: Password Generator

The focus of this project is to be able to create an application that generates a random password based on user-selected criteria. This app will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by a JavaScript code.

## The Acceptance Criteria To Be Followed:

```
GIVEN I need a new, secure password
WHEN I click the button to generate a password
THEN I am presented with a series of prompts for password criteria
WHEN prompted for password criteria
THEN I select which criteria to include in the password
WHEN prompted for the length of the password
THEN I choose a length of at least 8 characters and no more than 128 characters
WHEN prompted for character types to include in the password
THEN I choose lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters
WHEN I answer each prompt
THEN my input should be validated and at least one character type should be selected
WHEN all prompts are answered
THEN a password is generated that matches the selected criteria
WHEN the password is generated
THEN the password is either displayed in an alert or written to the page
```

## Javascript Changes:


- Added variables for password and generate
- Added prompt for how long password to be
- Added alert for user to choose between 8 and 128 password length
- To gather user input, confirm is used to ask for lowercase, uppercase, numbers, and/or special characters for password
- Added addEventListener for generating password


## Notes:

Although assignment is incomplete, it has reached thus far. Including the questions through using prompt, confirm, and alert was an accomplishment. Must work on the variables and using the proper tags and logic.
